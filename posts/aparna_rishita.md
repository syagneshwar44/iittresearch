# Our Journey with RISHA Lab  

It all started in our **5th semester** when we were asked to develop a mobile application for our **Software Engineering** course. We were clueless about everything, but with the help of **Akhila Sri Manasa**, who was our TA, we finally figured out a suitable project that aligned with our interests.  

That's when we realized **Software Engineering is an extensive line of work with many exciting topics**, and it's fascinating because it opens up diverse career paths.

## Our First Steps  

In our next semester, we worked on **Data-driven Requirements Engineering** and even wrote a draft paper - **REQKIT**. Developing software solutions and contributing to the software engineering community worldwide by publicizing our work was undoubtedly appealing, which piqued our interest in joining **RISHA Lab**.

## The Research Journey  

Our **BTP (B.Tech Project) work** started, and as we hit the ground running, we faced many roadblocks. One major challenge was that **the concept we planned to work on got published the very next week in the proceedings of MSR 2020**.  

### **Lesson learned**:  
_“Ideas will not remain novel indefinitely.”_  

Somehow, we found our groove and successfully published our work **APIScanner at the core A* conference - ICSE 2021**. It was our first **undergraduate research publication**, and the feeling was profound!

## A Memorable Experience  

The opportunity to **connect with and learn about state-of-the-art research** in the Software Engineering community as an author at **ICSE 2021** was only possible due to our experience at **RISHA Lab**.  

The passion and determination of RISHA Lab's members **encouraged and inspired us to do our best**. **Sridhar sir’s guidance** was crucial throughout our research and writing. For our **B.Tech project**, we couldn't have asked for a better adviser and mentor.  

### A Night to Remember  

I vividly remember **one night when we stayed up till 4:30 AM**, updating and finishing our **demo paper draft**—and **Sridhar sir was there guiding us through the whole night!**  

We are **grateful** for all the help and support we received and **thankful** for the research experience and connections we’ve acquired. However, we **wish we had spent more time physically in the lab** during the last two semesters, which were entirely virtual. We also **miss team outings**. 😢

## Sridhar Sir’s Patience & Encouragement  

Okay, I have to say it—**Sridhar sir has a lot of patience!** 😅  

We once **missed a couple of scrum updates**, yet he kept persuading us, reminding us to be more **empathetic**. He always **encouraged us to push our boundaries**.  

He was there **supporting us when we felt lost**, when we didn’t know which direction to take, or when we were **too anxious or nervous to present our work with little or no confidence**.  

---

## Final Thoughts  

### **Being part of the RISHA Lab was an unforgettable experience.**  

We **gained valuable research experience**, **learned from industry experts**, and **made meaningful connections**.  

> *Hard work is essential, but what's equally important is to enjoy the journey.*
