# Introduction to Professionalism: My Stint at RISHA Lab  

**RISHA (Research in Intelligent Software and Human Analytics) Lab**, led by Sridhar sir, was my happy hunting ground during the later stages of my engineering journey.  

## Beginning My Journey  

My first experience with the lab was after my sixth semester when I got an opportunity to work directly with Sridhar sir on **Bug Localization** as part of my B.Tech internship. I had initially secured an internship at **Bosch Engineering and Research Solutions, Bangalore**, but due to the prevailing COVID-19 situation, I was unable to continue. Sridhar sir was extremely supportive during that phase and offered me a position in the lab.  

During my previous interactions with sir, I had realized his **ambition and passion** for research. He expected us to push our limits and deliver our best. I knew I had to give my 100% during the internship.

## The Internship Experience  

At the start of my internship, sir helped me get accustomed to the **project workflow** within the lab. My primary task was to conduct research and improve the results of a **Neural Network** trained on large-scale datasets. This project was supported by **Bosch Labs**, giving me the opportunity to interact with **industry experts in Machine Learning**.  

The internship was an **invaluable learning experience**, and I was deeply satisfied with my work. This motivated me to continue my journey with **RISHA Lab** for my **B.Tech project**.  

## Research and Challenges  

At the beginning of my project, we conducted **extensive empirical research** to explore various problems. After careful analysis, we chose **"Source Code Summarization"** as our main research topic.  

While this topic has been widely explored in the past, we identified that **state-of-the-art automated summarization tools** were still far from perfect. Most research in this area focused on **static analysis** of source code, but we believed **dynamic analysis** could enhance the summaries.  

## The RISHA Lab Culture  

A key aspect of RISHA Lab is its **openness to new ideas**. Our work was not limited to a single research trackâ€”we always looked for ways to **expand and improve** our approach.  

For instance, during our project, we developed a **code learning assistance tool â€“ Observe and Code**. This tool provided **incomplete code snippets** along with **hints and descriptions** to help novice programmers complete them. Our B.Tech project's **Dynamic Code Analysis** approach was used to generate these hints, making learning more intuitive.  

Additionally, we explored **static code summarization using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**. We developed an **encoder-decoder framework with an attention mechanism** to translate code snippets into natural language descriptions. Although our initial results werenâ€™t satisfactory, **Sridhar sir was always supportive**, emphasizing that every failed experiment was still a valuable learning experience.  

> *"At least we now know what not to do, and this can be a good knowledge base for future work."* â€” Sridhar Sir  

## Working Towards International Conferences  

At RISHA Lab, every research project is aligned with **top international conferences**. Research quality is paramount, and every step is carefully documented. **Sridhar sir encourages us to prepare research drafts at every stage**, refining them continuously as the project progresses.  

For our project, we submitted papers to three major conferences:  

- **New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) track at ICSE 2021**  
- **Demonstrations track at ICSE 2021**  
- **Demonstrations track at FSE 2021**  

The process of submission was **rigorous**. We made continuous refinementsâ€”sometimes working **until 1â€“2 AM** with Sridhar sir personally guiding us. If the quality of our paper didnâ€™t meet the labâ€™s high standards, it **wasnâ€™t submitted**. This level of passion and professionalism set RISHA Lab apart.  

Another key advantage of aligning research with conferences was **structured workload distribution**. Unlike other teams that rushed towards the end of the semester, **RISHA Lab teams followed a well-structured plan**, maintaining a steady pace throughout the year.  

## Final Thoughts  

I will forever cherish my time at **RISHA Lab** and apply these learnings in my future endeavors. One lesson that will always stay with me is:  

> **"Hard work is important, but what's equally important is to enjoy the journey at the same time."**
