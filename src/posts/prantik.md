# **A Fascinating Journey of Research Through The Highs and Lows**

![My Time with RISHA Lab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NobleMathews/risha-main/master/src/Pages/_images/Prantik.jpg)

I joined **RISHA Lab** in May 2021 after completing my first year of **M.Tech**. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my entire first year was conducted online. As a Master's student, I needed to select a supervisor for my second-year project. With a keen interest in **Deep Learning**, particularly **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, I had an important decision to make.

### **Discovering RISHA Lab**
My journey into RISHA Lab was influenced by the **Software Engineering** course I took in my second semester. While the course itself didn’t particularly excite me, an empirical study we conducted within it introduced me to the fascinating intersection of **AI and Software Engineering**. During this time, I noticed that **Sridhar Sir** was among the most active researchers at the institute. 

So, when an email invitation arrived for M.Tech students to join RISHA Lab, I seized the opportunity. Before officially joining, I had an honest discussion with **Sridhar Sir**, admitting my lack of prior research experience. He reassured me that the most essential qualities were **persistence and hard work**—a message that resonated deeply with me.

### **The RISHA Experience**
Upon joining the lab, I met fellow researchers working on diverse projects. We had **weekly status updates** to discuss progress, challenges, and new ideas. Sridhar Sir provided insightful feedback and suggested innovative approaches. A unique aspect of RISHA Lab was the involvement of **undergraduate students**, working on cutting-edge projects. Initially, I felt a bit overwhelmed, but soon, I realized the lab’s **collaborative culture** encouraged learning from everyone.

During my time at RISHA Lab, I gained substantial knowledge in **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)**. I also became familiar with **GPUs and High-Performance Computing (HPC)** for training large models—an area I had little exposure to before.

One of the most **intense yet thrilling** moments was the conference submission process. We worked **late into the night**, racing against deadlines to refine our manuscripts. It was chaotic yet **incredibly rewarding**, like a well-oiled machine operating at full throttle.

### **Navigating Research Challenges**
I worked on two major projects:
1. **Source Code Summarization using API Information**
2. **API Misuse Detection in Python**

Most of my efforts went into the first project, which was eventually **published in November 2022**. The journey from **inception to publication** was a rollercoaster of excitement, setbacks, and perseverance.

Our goal was to **enhance state-of-the-art code summarization** by integrating **API Sequences** as an additional modality. Initially, we experimented with **Tree-LSTM models**, achieving improvements over basic RNNs. However, despite our efforts, the latest **Transformer models** still outperformed us significantly.

Next, we attempted a **multi-modal Transformer architecture**, hoping to push performance further. Unfortunately, the results were **disappointing**, as our model failed to surpass existing benchmarks. It felt like a **dead end**, and I doubted the value of our work. However, **Sridhar Sir** encouraged me to explore research that reported **negative results**, showing me that every experiment contributes to knowledge.

### **The Road to Publication**
As we transitioned to **writing the paper**, I faced another challenge—**academic writing**. Fortunately, I had the support of **Eashan** (a PhD student) and fellow lab members **Shriram and Akhila**, who tirelessly refined our manuscript. After multiple rounds of **reviews and revisions**, the paper was finally submitted. **It also became my M.Tech thesis.**

By June 2022, I had completed my M.Tech with **zero expectations** of our paper being accepted. However, on a fine morning in **August**, I received an email—our paper was **accepted for publication**! I was **overjoyed**, and in that moment, I recalled **Sridhar Sir’s advice** about the importance of perseverance. 

### **Final Reflections**
Looking back, I realize that even when research **does not yield expected results**, it **teaches us valuable lessons**. The experience of working at RISHA Lab, surrounded by **brilliant and supportive peers**, was a turning point in my academic journey. I strongly encourage passionate students to explore the **incredible opportunities at RISHA Lab**—because in research, you either **WIN or LEARN.**
