## Learning to Cope with the Unexpected

### A Journey of Growth and Resilience

"I first started working with Sridhar sir towards the end of my second year. At that time, he was teaching our batch and introduced us to the remarkable work being done by students worldwide. His vision to establish IIT Tirupati as a leading institute in software engineering research, on par with MIT and Stanford, deeply inspired me. The sheer diversity of research topics and the impact of the work at RISHA Lab motivated me to take the plunge. 

Despite having no prior knowledge of software engineering or research, Sridhar sir was very welcoming and assured me that everyone starts somewhere. With that encouragement, I embarked on my research journey with the group that would soon become RISHA Lab. Initially, only a handful of undergraduate students were involved, but as the lab's reputation grew, more students joined, transforming RISHA into a thriving research community."

### Expanding Horizons

"During my time at RISHA Lab, I had the opportunity to work on diverse projects beyond my coursework, including game development, software architecture, visualization tools, and deep learning. I started with development-heavy tasks and eventually transitioned into core research, securing multiple publications in esteemed conferences. Thanks to Sridhar sir’s mentorship, I also earned a research internship at the University of Waterloo in my third year and was later offered a fully funded Master’s position there.

The members of RISHA Lab are more than colleagues; they are like a growing family. We pushed each other to go beyond our limits. I fondly remember the countless all-nighters we pulled to meet deadlines, the hours spent brainstorming solutions, and even the occasional treat from Sridhar sir after an intense day of work. Reflecting on my undergraduate experience, I can confidently say that RISHA Lab played a pivotal role in shaping my academic and professional journey."

"I worked with Dheeraj on several course projects, hackathons, and competitions. He frequently shared insights about the projects he was working on at RISHA Lab and the exciting research being published in top conferences. I admired how Sridhar sir encouraged students to push beyond regular coursework, so I decided to join RISHA Lab in my fourth year to work on my BTP alongside Dheeraj.

We started strong, but some of our experiments didn’t yield the expected results, and we even faced a rejection from a conference. Rather than being discouraged, we explored alternative directions and actively engaged in extensive literature review. The process was rigorous but also incredibly rewarding. Our weekly meetings were dynamic, filled with brainstorming sessions where we evaluated different ideas critically. One of the most valuable aspects of working at RISHA Lab was learning to think outside the box."

"Adapting to remote work during the pandemic was initially challenging, but weekly online meetings kept us on track. We quickly learned the importance of perseverance, as we had to pivot our approach multiple times based on our findings. Eventually, we discovered a novel research direction that shaped not only our BTP but also contributed to ongoing research at RISHA Lab."

"Our research faced an unexpected hurdle when I had to take a prolonged break due to a medical emergency. Karthik stepped up and took on the entire workload, ensuring our project stayed on track despite the uncertainty. His dedication was instrumental in keeping our work alive. I am also deeply grateful to Sridhar sir for his unwavering support and understanding, allowing me to focus on my recovery without additional stress.

Although we faced setbacks, Sridhar sir encouraged us to persist even after formally completing our BTP. With determination and relentless effort, we refined our research and ultimately secured a publication in one of the top software engineering conferences. I vividly remember staying awake until 4:50 AM, anxiously waiting for the conference notification. The moment it arrived, I immediately messaged sir and woke up Karthik. That night reaffirmed how a great team can tackle even the most unexpected challenges."

### The RISHA Lab Experience: Win or Learn

Our journey at RISHA Lab taught us that research doesn’t always yield immediate success—but when it doesn’t, it teaches us valuable lessons that guide us toward the right path. In research, it’s either *win* or *learn*. For students passionate about pushing their boundaries and exploring cutting-edge research, RISHA Lab is an incredible opportunity that we strongly recommend.
