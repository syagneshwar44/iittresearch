# **My Journey into Software Engineering: From Projects to Papers**

![My Time with RISHA Lab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NobleMathews/risha-main/master/src/Pages/_images/preethi.jpg)

## **A Turning Point in My Academic Path**

It all started when I enrolled in a **Software Engineering** course during my **5th semester**. Little did I know that this course would shape my academic and professional journey in ways I hadn’t imagined. 

During that semester, I worked on projects that were deeply tied to real-world applications. These weren’t just coursework assignments—they were hands-on experiences that opened my eyes to the practical side of software engineering. The mentorship I received from **Akhila Sri Manasa Ma’am** and **Sridhar Sir** was invaluable, playing a crucial role in my growth. Since then, I had always wanted to be a part of **RISHA Lab**. However, due to my hectic semester schedule, I couldn’t pursue this interest at the time. But fate had other plans.

## **Diving Deeper: The Software Engineering Lab**

In the very next semester, I took up the **Software Engineering Lab** course, which involved working on two major projects focused on **sustainability**—a topic that immediately fascinated me. My team brainstormed and came up with an idea: **measuring the energy consumption of Python code snippets**. Initially, it seemed like a simple concept, but after discussions with **Sridhar Sir** and **Rajrupa Ma’am**, we expanded it into something much bigger—**measuring the energy consumption of database systems**. 

Who would have thought that this project would become the foundation of my research for the next **year**?

## **Joining RISHA Lab and Taking on a B.Tech Project**

As the semester progressed, we were asked to **choose a B.Tech project guide**, and without hesitation, my thoughts returned to **RISHA Lab**. My teammate and I approached **Sridhar Sir**, and we decided to extend our previous work into a **full-fledged research project**.

### **Phase 1: The ICSE 2024 Submission**

Our first major milestone was enhancing our tool and submitting a research paper to **ICSE 2024**. However, despite our hard work, the paper **wasn’t accepted**. It was a tough moment, and I felt disheartened. But **Sridhar Sir** never let us give up—he encouraged us to keep improving and refining our work.

### **Phase 2: A New Goal – The EASE Conference**

We went back to the drawing board, focusing on **improving our tool** and conducting more comprehensive experiments. This time, our target was the **EASE conference**. We refined our work, conducted rigorous experiments, and finally submitted the paper. One of the most memorable moments during this submission process was staying up until **2 AM**—something totally out of the norm for me, as I usually fall asleep by **10 PM**!

## **A Dream Come True: Paper Acceptance!**

A few weeks after submission, we received a **shepherding request** from the **EASE committee**, asking for revisions to our paper. We worked tirelessly to improve it, and then came the day that changed everything.

I remember it vividly. I had to travel back to campus that morning. As soon as I woke up, I checked my email and saw the notification: **our paper was accepted!** I was overjoyed and ran to wake up my mother to share the news. She was equally excited for me. 

Later that day, while on the train, I received a **call from Sridhar Sir**, who was attending the **ICSE conference in Portugal**. He congratulated me and told me that it was my **persistence and hard work** that made this achievement possible. I was thrilled that I had never given up, and I still remember my co-passenger asking me why I was so excited!

## **Lessons Learned and Advice for Future Students**

The journey wasn’t always smooth—some weeks saw **no progress**, while others were filled with **breakthroughs and new ideas**. However, **Sridhar Sir’s patience and encouragement never wavered**, and for that, I am forever grateful.

To anyone who dreams of working with **RISHA Lab**: if you are truly passionate about research, it is an **incredible opportunity**. My experience in the lab helped me grow both as a researcher and as an individual. 

One of the most valuable aspects of the lab was the **Weekly Status Review (WSR) meetings**. These sessions were structured like real-world work environments, giving us an early taste of professional life. The discipline, collaboration, and problem-solving skills I developed during my time in **RISHA Lab** have prepared me for any challenge that comes my way.

## **Final Thoughts**

If you ever get the chance to **be a part of RISHA Lab**, **take it!** The journey may be challenging at times, but it will push you to **grow, learn, and achieve things you never thought possible**. I will always cherish my time in **RISHA Lab**, and I hope my story inspires future students to embark on their own exciting research journey.
