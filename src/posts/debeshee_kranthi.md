# 🚀 RISHA Lab: A Launchpad for Aspiring Undergrad Researchers

Debeshee and Kranthi, from the B-Tech Batch of 2023, embarked on unique individual journeys with RISHA Lab, ultimately culminating in their Bachelor's Thesis together. In this blog, they reflect on their diverse experiences, offering insights into the exciting and varied opportunities that RISHA Lab has to offer! 💡✨

## 🌟 The Beginning: A Chance Encounter  
### 📝 *Debeshee*

In our first few weeks at IIT Tirupati, we were wide-eyed and eager to explore everything university life had to offer! During induction week, a session introduced us to our departments. This is where I first met **Dr. Sridhar Chimalakonda**.

Unlike the formal sessions we had anticipated, Dr. Sridhar sat casually on a bench rather than taking the stage. He welcomed us with engaging anecdotes and presented his core belief:  
> **“You should push your boundaries to achieve great things!”**

He emphasized that regardless of where you come from, hard work makes anything possible. His own journey and dedication to research were embodied in **RISHA Lab**.

## 🔬 First Steps into Research  
### 🔍 *Debeshee: Winter 2021 - Security in Competitive Programming*  

My RISHA Lab journey began with a **winter research project in 2021**. I got the chance to work with some of the most inspiring people and even wrote an actual **research paper in my third year!** 🎓✨

Teaming up with **Noble**, we explored security vulnerabilities in competitive programming data, leading to insightful findings. Our study was submitted to **EASE 2022**—and got accepted! 🎉 Despite the pandemic shifting the conference online, it was an exhilarating experience presenting our work to an international audience.

### 🤖 *Kranthi: A Leap into AI & Social Media Research*  

I joined **RISHA Lab at the start of my third year**, eager but intimidated by the high expectations. However, my decision to take the leap proved invaluable: **new friendships, published papers, and an exciting Bachelor’s thesis.**

My first assignment paired me with **Sachin** on the project *Mood of India after the Pandemic*, an extension of prior research. Under the patient guidance of **Eashaan Bhaiya**, we scraped data, trained models, and navigated weekly research meetings. Although our first paper never saw publication due to inconclusive correlations, it was a **valuable lesson in the research process**.

## 🔥 Diving Deeper: Industry Research & AI4SE  
### 🤝 *Debeshee: IBM Research Internship & COMEX Tool*

In Summer 2022, I had the opportunity to work on a collaborative project between **IBM Research India and RISHA Lab**, exploring **AI4SE (Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering)**. Our ambitious goal: build a framework to generate **customizable code-view combinations** for AI-based software engineering research.

Guided by **Alex & Srikanth from IBM**, I gained hands-on experience in **building an open-source framework, structuring large codebases, defining & redefining problem statements, and testing methodologies**. The daily mentor meetings introduced me to the fast-paced world of **industry research**, solidifying my passion for the field.

Even after the official three-month internship ended, we continued refining the framework, now named **COMEX**. With **Noble’s** involvement, we enhanced its capabilities, leading to a submission at **ASE 2023 (Automated Software Engineering Conference)**. 🎉 **COMEX was accepted** and I had the privilege to present it in **Luxembourg**!

### 🏗 *Kranthi: Tackling AI Challenges in Code Understanding*

For our **B-Tech project (Bachelor’s Thesis)**, we decided to extend **COMEX** and integrate **structured code representations** into transformer-based models. Unlike natural language, **code has inherent structure**, and we aimed to leverage **spatial & flow information** to improve model performance.

🔹 We delved into transformer architectures, analyzing models like **CodeBERT** and **GraphCodeBERT**.  
🔹 Inspired by **Alex’s Code Clone Detection** research, we expanded it to **Semantic Code Search, Code Classification, and Code Translation**.
🔹 Debugging large-scale **transformer training on IBM’s clusters** was a huge challenge—memory leaks, long job queues, and unexpected bottlenecks tested our patience.

Despite these hurdles, **our approach worked!** However, reviewers of our **TOSEM journal submission** demanded comparisons with proprietary large-scale models, leading to an unfortunate rejection. Though disheartening, we successfully defended our B-Tech thesis and submitted a **100-page detailed report** of our work.

## 🎢 The RISHA Lab Experience: Lessons & Takeaways

Our journey with **RISHA Lab and Dr. Sridhar Chimalakonda** was an **unforgettable roller coaster**. From research failures to international presentations, we grew resilient, gained technical expertise, and built lasting friendships. **Pushing our limits—just as Sir always recommended—shaped us into the researchers we are today.**

🔹 **Key Lessons:**  
✅ *Failure is part of research.*  
✅ *Persistence always pays off.*  
✅ *A strong research community is invaluable.*  

💙 **Thank you, RISHA Lab, for our first research adventure—it was an experience to cherish forever!** 🚀✨
