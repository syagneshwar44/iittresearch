# **MS @ IITT with Dr. Sridhar Chimalakonda and RISHA Lab: A Journey of Exploration and Resilience**

I joined IIT Tirupati as a Master's student in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering in the fall of 2020. Choosing Education Technology as my research domain, I became a Research Scholar in EdTech at RISHA Lab. Little did I know the incredible journey that awaited me. 

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, I was immediately struck by the lab's diverse research areas, ranging from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to EdTech and Machine Learning (ML) applications in software engineering. Having previously worked as a software engineer, I was fascinated by how some of my favorite developer tools—Postman, Chrome DevTools, and Prettier—might have originated from research labs like ours.

## **Exploring New Frontiers**

Initially, HCI projects piqued my interest. However, as I delved deeper into the lab’s work, I was drawn to software engineering projects. RISHA Lab was dedicated to creating tools that simplified life for students, programmers, and industry professionals, ultimately striving to make the world a better place. Inspired by this mission, I transitioned my research from EdTech to Software Engineering, with my supervisor's unwavering support.

My journey began with a project outside my thesis topic: a stack trace visualization tool designed to help novice programmers understand error messages and debug efficiently. This project introduced me to research fundamentals—scientific writing, effective presentations, literature reviews, surveys, quantitative evaluations, and managing deadlines. Although it wasn’t part of my thesis, it laid a strong foundation for my future research.

## **Contributing During the Pandemic**

Conducting research virtually during COVID-19 presented unique challenges. Instead of being deterred, we focused on building technological solutions to assist those in need. We developed an oxygen cylinder and bed availability portal and a social media platform for COVID patients to share their experiences. Leading one of these projects was an eye-opening experience, showing me how research can be directly applied to solve real-world problems in times of crisis.

## **Diving Into Thesis Work**

When the world started recovering from the pandemic, we finally got the chance to work offline. IIT Tirupati’s breathtaking campus, with its scenic mountain backdrop, provided the perfect environment for research. 

I embarked on my thesis on **energy-efficient deep learning patterns**, collaborating with Accenture Labs. However, research proved to be an ongoing battle—moments of feeling lost, stuck, and directionless were frequent. The pressure to make progress mounted as I struggled to analyze collected data. I spent months studying literature, only to uncover more flaws and gaps in my understanding.

During these times, my supervisor’s words provided clarity—research is a never-ending process, and we can never predict our peers' reactions until we submit our work. He often humorously reminded me of a man who missed his pilgrimage to Kashi because he repeatedly checked if his house was locked—emphasizing that perfectionism can hinder progress.

## **Facing Setbacks and Finding Success**

With this wisdom, I mustered the courage to submit my first full paper, and to my delight, it was accepted on the first attempt at **EASE**. However, not every submission saw success. Throughout my MS journey, I faced multiple rejections, teaching me one of the most valuable lessons—**persistence in the face of setbacks**. Research demands resilience and the ability to embrace rejection as part of the process.

RISHA Lab’s culture encouraged exploration beyond our thesis work. I had the opportunity to work on **game anti-patterns and federated learning for software engineering research**, expanding my knowledge beyond my primary domain.

## **Presenting at International Conferences**

A highlight of my MS journey was presenting my research at **international conferences**. Despite pandemic restrictions, I had the incredible opportunity to attend two conferences—one in **Cyprus** and another in **Singapore**—to present work outside my thesis (a unique advantage of our lab’s philosophy). These conferences provided a platform to showcase research, learn from experts, and network with top professionals. Attending conferences is an invaluable experience for any researcher, offering new collaborations, insights, and perspectives.

Moreover, both trips were fully sponsored—the **Cyprus trip was funded by the institute**, while the **Singapore trip was supported by Sigsoft CAPS and Microsoft Research**.

## **A Journey of Growth and Gratitude**

Reflecting on my MS experience at IIT Tirupati, I am immensely grateful for the opportunities and unwavering support I received. RISHA Lab nurtured not only my academic growth but also my resilience, discipline, and determination to excel in research. 

Beyond research, the friendships I built made this journey even more meaningful. As I conclude this chapter, I carry invaluable lessons, cherished memories, and a profound appreciation for software engineering research—equipped with the skills and mindset to continue pushing boundaries in the field.
