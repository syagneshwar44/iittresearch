# **Transformative Journey: My RISHA Lab Experience at IIT Tirupati**

My journey with RISHA Lab at IIT Tirupati began when I arrived to pursue my M.Tech degree. Little did I know that this experience would be life-changing in more ways than one.

## **The Beginning: A Challenging yet Exciting Start**

In my first semester, I had the privilege of being taught by Dr. Sridhar Chimalakonda in the Software Engineering course. His teaching style was unique and challenging. He assigned tasks that initially felt almost impossible—like reading 100 research papers in a week! However, we soon realized that these tasks were designed to enhance our ability to quickly skim research papers and extract essential information.

One significant turning point came when he assigned a term paper as an assignment. I teamed up with Venigalla Akhila Sri Manasa, and together, we submitted the paper. Our dedication caught Sridhar Sir's attention, and he saw potential in us. This led to an invitation to join RISHA Lab—an opportunity that changed everything for me.

## **Exploring New Frontiers at RISHA Lab**

RISHA Lab was a hub of creativity and innovation. Our brainstorming sessions covered a wide array of topics, including:
- Software design and code smells
- Enhancing software features
- Developing plugins and open-source games
- Software documentation
- Human-computer interaction (HCI)
- Educational game development

One unforgettable experience was when the **Smart India Hackathon** for undergraduates coincided with the **ICALT deadline**. I obtained special permission to work through the night on my conference papers, and that intense effort resulted in submitting three conference papers in the HCI domain—all of which were accepted! It was a breakthrough moment after struggling to get publications as the primary author.

## **Academic Success and Industry Recognition**

In 2020, I received the **ACM Women Scholarship Award** for my ICALT papers and also had another poster accepted at **ICSE**. Having four publications in a row was overwhelming and exciting, although the pandemic prevented me from attending these conferences in person.

Amidst these achievements, my primary focus remained on my M.Tech project, which revolved around **antipatterns in open-source games**. This project faced its fair share of rejections, but Sridhar Sir's unwavering support and belief in our work kept me going.

## **Transitioning to Industry While Continuing Research**

After completing my M.Tech in June 2020, I joined **FactSet Hyderabad** as a **Machine Learning Engineer**. Despite my full-time job, I continued working with RISHA Lab on existing projects, such as:
- **Game Engines Dataset**
- **BlockList**
- **Architecture of Unreal Engine**
- Further research on my own M.Tech project

Together, we persevered, and after numerous efforts, we managed to get our work recognized at various national and international conferences, including **ICSE and MSE**. One of my proudest moments was when my M.Tech research was published as a **journal paper in the prestigious Journal of Systems and Software (JSS).**

## **Gratitude and Reflection**

All of these achievements were possible because of Sir's consistent support and belief in our projects. I must also acknowledge the incredible team spirit of my fellow RISHA Lab members, including **Venigalla Akhila Sri Manasa, A Eashan Rao, Shriram Shanbhag, and Dheeraj Vagavolu.** Their support played a crucial role in our collective success.

A special thanks to **Sridhar Sir** for creating such an inspiring and motivating RISHA Lab. He is not just a professor but a true mentor, progressive thinker, and believer in his students. My journey with RISHA Lab has been truly life-changing, and I will forever cherish the brainstorming sessions, rigorous discussions, late-night paper submissions, and our team outings.

### **To my RISHA Lab family—let's always stay in touch! :)**
